# we-ne

### Project Status
This project is currently under **Superteam Japan Grants review**.
It is in a **PoC / v0** phase, focused on the demo flow below.

### What works today (Demo Flow)
- Scan event QR code
- View event details
- Claim a digital participation ticket
- Ticket is stored and viewable in the app

### First Target Use Case: School Event Participation Ticket
The first concrete use case of **We-ne** is a **digital participation ticket for school events and volunteer activities**.

- Students scan a QR code at the event venue
- A non-transferable digital participation ticket is issued instantly
- No monetary value or exchangeability
- Personal information (name, student number) is not exposed externally
- Event organizers can verify participation counts via an admin interface

This use case prioritizes **speed, usability, and privacy**, making it suitable for real educational environments.

### Next Milestone (Short-term)
- Simplified Scan → Confirm → Success flow
- Basic admin dashboard (issued / completed counts)
- Short demo video showcasing the full flow

> **Instant, transparent benefit distribution on Solana — built for Japan's public support needs**

## 🎯 What is we-ne?

we-ne is a **non-custodial benefit distribution system** built on Solana, designed to deliver support payments instantly and transparently.

**One-liner**: SPL token grants with periodic claims, double-claim prevention, and mobile wallet integration — all verifiable on-chain.

---

## 🚨 Problem & Why It Matters

### The Problem (Japan Context)

In Japan, public support programs suffer from:
- **Slow delivery**: Weeks/months from application to receipt
- **High overhead**: Administrative costs eat into small grants
- **Opacity**: Hard to verify if funds reached intended recipients
- **Inflexibility**: Fixed schedules don't match urgent needs

### Global Relevance

These problems exist worldwide:
- Disaster relief that arrives too late
- Micro-grants where fees exceed value
- Aid programs lacking accountability

### Our Solution

we-ne provides:
- ⚡ **Instant delivery**: Claims settle in seconds
- 💰 **Low cost**: ~$0.001 per transaction
- 🔍 **Full transparency**: Every claim verifiable on-chain
- 📱 **Mobile-first**: Recipients claim via smartphone

**Key Components**:
1. **Smart Contract** (`grant_program/`): Anchor program managing grants, claims, and receipts
2. **Mobile App** (`wene-mobile/`): React Native app for recipients to claim benefits
3. **Phantom Integration**: Non-custodial signing via deep links

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (recommended: v20 LTS)
- For smart contract: Rust, Solana CLI v1.18+, Anchor v0.30+
- For mobile: Android SDK (API 36), Java 17

### One-command build (for contributors / third parties)

From the **repository root** you can build and test everything without entering each subproject. The steps below are verified in a third-party environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/we-ne.git
cd we-ne

# Option A: npm scripts (requires Node at root)
npm install   # optional: only if you want to run root scripts
npm run build      # build contract + mobile typecheck
npm run test       # run Anchor tests

# Option B: shell script (no root Node required)
chmod +x scripts/build-all.sh
./scripts/build-all.sh all    # build + test contract + mobile typecheck
./scripts/build-all.sh build  # build only
./scripts/build-all.sh test   # contract tests only
```

**What success looks like**

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm run build` / `build-all.sh build` | Contract builds with `anchor build`; mobile passes `npm install` + `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run test` / `build-all.sh test` | Anchor tests (e.g. create_grant, fund_grant, claimer can claim once per period) pass |
| `build-all.sh all` | All of the above; ends with "✅ Done." |

**Dependency note (mobile)**  
The mobile app (`wene-mobile`) can hit npm peer dependency errors due to React/react-dom version mismatch. The repo uses `wene-mobile/.npmrc` (`legacy-peer-deps=true`) and `--legacy-peer-deps` in root scripts and CI, so **you can run the root build and CI as-is**. For mobile-only setup, use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` as in "Run Mobile App" below.

See [Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for per-component setup and [Recent changes](#-recent-changes-third-party-build-improvements) for what was added for third-party builds.

### Run Mobile App (Development)

```bash
# From repo root (after cloning — see "One-command build" above)
cd wene-mobile

# One-command setup (recommended)
npm run setup

# Or manual setup:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run doctor:fix          # Check and fix common issues
npx expo prebuild --clean   # Generate native projects

# Start Expo dev server
npm start
```

### Build Android APK

```bash
# From repo root
cd wene-mobile
npm run build:apk

# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Troubleshooting

Use the built-in doctor script to diagnose and fix issues:

```bash
# Check for issues
npm run doctor

# Auto-fix issues
npm run doctor:fix
```

The doctor checks: dependencies, polyfills, SafeArea configuration, Phantom integration, Android SDK setup, and more.

### Build Smart Contract

```bash
# From repo root
cd grant_program
anchor build
anchor test
```

→ Full setup: [Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

## 🔐 Security Model

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Key custody** | Non-custodial — keys never leave Phantom wallet |
| **Session tokens** | Encrypted with NaCl box, stored in app sandbox |
| **Double-claim** | Prevented by on-chain ClaimReceipt PDA |
| **Deep links** | Encrypted payloads, strict URL validation |

⚠️ **Audit Status**: NOT AUDITED — use at own risk for testing only

→ Full threat model: [Security](./docs/SECURITY.md)

## 📋 Recent changes (third-party build improvements)

To make the project easier to build and verify for contributors and third parties:

- **Root-level scripts**: Added `package.json` at repo root with `npm run build` (contract + mobile typecheck) and `npm run test` (Anchor tests). Use `npm run build:contract`, `npm run build:mobile`, `npm run test:contract` for per-component runs.
- **Unified build script**: Added `scripts/build-all.sh` so you can run `./scripts/build-all.sh all` (or `build` / `test`) without installing Node at root.
- **Third-party build verification**: Confirmed that the above steps build and test successfully in a fresh environment. Mobile React/react-dom peer dependency handling: `wene-mobile/.npmrc` (`legacy-peer-deps=true`) and `--legacy-peer-deps` in root scripts and CI.
- **CI**: Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so every push/PR runs Anchor build & test and mobile install & TypeScript check. The CI badge in this README reflects that workflow once the repo is on GitHub.
- **Docs**: [Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) updated with root-level build/test and CI usage.
- **Double-claim fix**: In `grant_program`, the claim receipt account was changed from `init_if_needed` to `init`. This correctly rejects a second claim in the same period (receipt PDA already exists, so `init` fails). All Anchor tests, including "claimer can claim once per period", now pass.
